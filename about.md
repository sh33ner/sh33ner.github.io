This blog is an effort to share some ideas about effectively managing complex systems. In my career, I have worked with hundreds of people across the globe in a number of different projects. I've worked in QA teams, infrastructure teams, Adobe Managed Services, and now as a CSME for AEM as a Cloud Service. Through all of those experiences, I've learned that managing systems is much more than just maintaining a SLA, but about building confidence in the teams trusted to deliver excellence.

My work experience is built on my education at Brigham Young University. There I recieved a B.S in Information Technology with a minor in Marketing and a M.S in Technology where my thesis was on cyber security education. Occassionally, I present in the IT 391R seminar series on topics similar to what you may find here. 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
