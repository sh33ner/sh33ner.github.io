This blog is an effort to share some ideas about effectively managing complex systems. In my career, I have worked with hundreds of people across the globe in a number of different projects. I've worked in QA teams, infrastructure teams, Adobe Managed Services, and now as a CSME for AEM as a Cloud Service. 

I recieved a bachelor's of science degree in Information Technology at Brigham Young University (2011), and a master's of science degree in Technology (2015) from there as well. My master's thesis focused on cyber security education. Through all of these different experiences and opportunities, I've learned how fulfilling it can be to work with teams to successfully manage a complex system. I hope that something I can share will be of value.
