## Equivalent Products

Imagine for a second that you own a deli, and that your method of slicing meat at this deli is with a tried and true knife that is perfectly sharp and which you have sliced thousands of meats with. Business starts to pick up, and I can see you're not getting as much done as you could. I come to you with a meat slicer that allows you to slice 4 or 5 times the amount of meat with perfect consistency just like your knife. You now have the capacity to increase business, the speed of delivery, without sacrificing the quality you used to use with your trusted knife. And then you say, "I can't use that slicer." 

"Why", I ask?

"Because the blade on it isn't straight. It's a circle."

This is a metaphor for what's happening across organizations that are suddenly confronted with the opportunity of using CI/CD pipelines to increase the efficiency, reliability, and quality of deployments.

Thus in thinking of mechanizing a large organization, it won’t work if you try to keep things in detail exactly the same, rather there must be a larger give-and-take if there is to be a significant success. You must get the essentials of the job in mind and then design the mechanization to do that job rather than trying to mechanize the current version—if you want a significant success in the long run.
